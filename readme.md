# Developers Best Friend: A Laravel framework application

Application that generates Lorem Ipsum text and user/s data. A visitor to the application is required to input the number of Lorem Ipsum paragraphs to be generated and displayed. Also required is the number of users to generate and if selected birth date and profile are displayed

The application uses 2 packages: One generates the Lorem Ipsum  by  Sam Williams <sam@badcow.co>  and Mathew Tinsley <tinsley@tinsology.net>. The other generates " interesting, sometimes entertaining, random names" by Spencer Rinehart <anubis@overthemonkey.com>
